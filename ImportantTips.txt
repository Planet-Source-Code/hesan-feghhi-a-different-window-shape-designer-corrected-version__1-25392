Tips when using HN Form Shape Designer:

1)You can draw as many polygons as you want, all of them will be combined.

2)If you want to draw polygons and also choose the background, choose the
  background first, because in every background change, polylines will be
  reset.

3)Masking a Picture is not a good way, because it makes the program
  initialization slow.

4)Whenever you are finished with a polygon, Right-click to close it.

5)Do not affect a form more than one time with the same "Shaper Procedure Name"

6)Always add Region.bas to your project or copy-paste the text in the bottom of the
  Procedure.

7)Good Luck!
